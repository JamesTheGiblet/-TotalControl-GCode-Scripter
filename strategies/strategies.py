     """
     Applies deposition sequence optimization strategies (Phase 2.1.2).
     This is a placeholder for implementing logic like:
     - Overhang handling (extra perimeters, infill first, inside-out perimeters, overlap, infill increase)
     - Small feature/layer cooling (pauses, reordering)
     - Other feature-specific ordering based on adhesion/stress.

     Currently, this function is a placeholder and returns the input lines unchanged.
     Actual implementation requires parsing G-code into structured segments with feature types,
     geometric analysis (overhangs, size), and complex G-code modification/generation.

     Args:
         gcode_lines (list[str]): A list of G-code command strings.
         printer_profile (PrinterProfile, optional): The loaded printer profile containing limits and settings. Defaults to None.

     Returns:
         list[str]: A list of G-code command strings after applying optimization strategies.

     # --- Future Implementation Steps (Conceptual) ---
     # 1. Parse gcode_lines into structured segments (Layer, Feature Type, GCode lines, maybe geometry/time info)
     # 2. Analyze segments for overhangs, size, estimated print time per segment/layer (needs printer_profile).
     # 3. Apply overhang strategy to relevant segments/layers.
     # 4. Apply small feature/layer cooling strategy (needs printer_profile).
     # 5. Reorder segments within layers based on the chosen strategies.
     # 6. Reconstruct G-code lines from the reordered/modified segments.
